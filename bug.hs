```haskell
import Data.List (nub)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = nub xs
  print ys
```
This code snippet uses `nub` from `Data.List` to remove duplicate elements from a list. However, if the list contains elements that are not directly comparable using `Ord`, it will result in a runtime error. For instance, if we try to use `nub` on a list containing custom data types without defined `Ord` instance, the program will crash.

```haskell
data MyData = MyData {x :: Int, y :: String}

instance Show MyData where
  show (MyData x y) = "(" ++ show x ++ "," ++ y ++ ")"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [MyData 1 "a", MyData 2 "b", MyData 1 "a"]
  let ys = nub xs
  print ys
```
This will result in a runtime error because `nub` requires an `Ord` instance to compare the elements. Without it, `nub` cannot determine which elements are duplicates and thus cannot remove them. The solution is to add an `Ord` instance for the `MyData` data type.
